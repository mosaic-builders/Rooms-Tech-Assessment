# Rooms Tech Assessment

**Getting started**. Look through the example model and solution in the [`example` folder](https://github.com/mosaic-builders/Rooms-Tech-Assessment/tree/master/example) to familiarize yourself with the problem.

**Implement your solution**. And apply it to `model.xml`.

**Submit your solution**. When youâ€™re done, ZIP your source code and email it to Max (max@mosaic.us). If you would like us to run your code, please also include instructions on how to install or setup, and execute your code. 

Thank you very much for your interest once again!
